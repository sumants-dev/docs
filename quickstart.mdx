### Create the Privacy Layer Service

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Docker is required to build and run the service. If you don't have Docker installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Pontus Locally">
    Clone the Pontus repository locally using this command: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PontusAI/Pontus.git
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Set Up Configuration File">
    Create a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```env
    postgres_db_conn_str=<put-your-conn-str-here> // The Postgres database needs pgvector
    anonymizer_key=<put-random-16-character-string>
    openai_api_key=<put-your-openai-api-key-here>
    ```

    Create a `pontus.yaml` file in the root directory of the repository. The file will read environment variables from your local environment or the `.env` file. For the quick start, we recommend copying the example file with the following command:

    ```bash
    cp pontus.example.yaml pontus.yaml
    ```

    After copying the example YAML, you will have the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    version: "0.1"
    privacy:
      encryption:
        encryption_method: AES
        key: env:anonymizer_key
      entity_resolution: containment
      sensitive_data:
        sensitive_data_method: presidio
        threshold: .5
        sensitive_data_types:
          - person
          - email_address
    application:
      database:
        type: postgres
        conn_str: env:postgres_db_conn_str
      authentication:
        type: no_auth
    llm:
      provider:
        type: openai
        default_model: gpt-3.5-turbo
        api_key: env:openai_api_key
      cache:
        type: small_cache
        vector_collection:
          type: pgvector
          conn_str: env:postgres_db_conn_str
          collection_name: prompt_cache
        embedder:
          type: sentence_transformer
          model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    document_store:
      vector_collection:
        type: pgvector
        conn_str: env:postgres_db_conn_str
        collection_name: node
      chunker:
        type: simple
        chunk_overlap: 10
      embedder:
        type: sentence_transformer
        model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build Service" icon="docker">
    We use Docker to build and run the service, so it is required to have Docker installed on your machine.
    Build the service with the following command:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to access the documentation for the running service at `https://localhost:4200`.

### Using the Privacy Layer

Choose either the standard or advanced method to use the privacy layer service. The standard method is recommended for most users.

**Standard**

This is a drop-in replacement for your existing AI service.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start a Chat Completion Session" icon="message">
    Our chat completion endpoint interacts with an LLM provider specified in the configuration file. The endpoint will return a completion for the given prompt.

    Here is an example of a request to the chat completion endpoint in Python:

    ```python
    import requests
    base_url = "http://localhost:4200"

    request = {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
          {
              "role": "system",
              "content": """Do not answer the question until the context below is used.\n 
              Here is the context: Rushabh. Rushabh is very passionate about technology and loves tinkering with new products. 
              He enjoys spending quality time in nature in his free time. 
              He's early in his career, so he's willing to forgo salary for career growth.""",
              "name": "context"
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": """Please explain the importance of the following factors: 
              Compensation, Work Life Balance, Company mission when Rushabh is looking for jobs.""",
              "name": "rankings"
          }
      ]
    }

    res = requests.post(f"{api_url}/llm/chat/completions?debug=true", json=request)
    response = res.json()
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Advanced**

Use this approach if you want to have more control over the calls to LLMs yourself.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Anonymize">
    Anonymize prompts that will be sent to LLMs. This endpoint will return a prompt with anonymized entities.

    ```python
    import requests
    api_url = "http://localhost:4200"

    body =  {
      "session_id": "test-session-id",
      "messages":[
          {
            "role":"user",
            "content":"Rushabh is cool"
          }
      ]
    }

    anonymized_messages = requests.post(api_url + "/privacy/anonymize", json=body)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Call LLM Provider">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deanonymize">

  ```python
    api_url = "http://localhost:4200"

    body =  {
      "session_id": "test-session-id"
      "anonymized_messages":[
          {
            "role":"user",
            "content":"αPERSON_0α is cool"
          }
      ]
    }

    anonymized_messages = requests.post(api_url + "/privacy/deanonymize", json=body)
  ```
