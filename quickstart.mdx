### Create the Privacy Layer Service

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Docker is required to build and run the service. If you don't have Docker installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Pontus Locally">
    Clone the Pontus repository locally using this command: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PontusAI/Pontus.git
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Set Up Configuration File">
    Create a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```env
    postgres_db_conn_str=<put-your-conn-str-here> // The Postgres database needs pgvector
    anonymizer_key=<put-random-16-character-string>
    openai_api_key=<put-your-openai-api-key-here>
    ```

    Create a `pontus.yaml` file in the root directory of the repository. The file will read environment variables from your local environment or the `.env` file. For the quick start, we recommend copying the example file with the following command:

    ```bash
    cp pontus.example.yaml pontus.yaml
    ```

    After copying the example YAML, you will have the following configuration:

    ```yaml pontus.yaml
    version: "0.1"
    privacy:
      encryption:
        encryption_method: AES
        key: env:anonymizer_key

        sensitive_data_method: presidio
        threshold: .5
        sensitive_data_types:
          - person
          - email_address

      database:

        embedder:
          type: sentence_transformer
          model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2

      embedder:

        model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build Service" icon="docker">
    We use Docker to build and run the service, so it is required to have Docker installed on your machine.
    Build the service with the following command:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to access the documentation for the running service at `https://localhost:4200`.

### Using the Privacy Layer

Choose either the standard or advanced method to use the privacy layer service. The standard method is recommended for most users.

**Standard**

This is a drop-in replacement for your existing AI service.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start a Chat Completion Session" icon="message">
    Our chat completion endpoint interacts with an LLM provider specified in the configuration file. The endpoint will return a completion for the given prompt.

    Here is an example of a request to the chat completion endpoint in Python:

    ```python
    import requests
    base_url = "http://localhost:4200"

    request = {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
          {
              "role": "system",
              "content": """Do not answer the question until the context below is used.\n 
              Here is the context: Rushabh. Rushabh is very passionate about technology and loves tinkering with new products. 
              He enjoys spending quality time in nature in his free time. 
              He's early in his career, so he's willing to forgo salary for career growth.""",
              "name": "context"
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "content": """Please explain the importance of the following factors: 
              Compensation, Work Life Balance, Company mission when Rushabh is looking for jobs.""",
              "name": "rankings"
          }
      ]
    }

    res = requests.post(f"{api_url}/llm/chat/completions?debug=true", json=request)
    response = res.json()
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Advanced**

Use this approach if you want to have more control over the calls to LLMs yourself.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Anonymize">
    Anonymize prompts that will be sent to LLMs. This endpoint will return a prompt with anonymized entities.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```python example.py
        import requests
        body =  {
          "messages":[
                {

Rushabh is very passionate about technology and loves tinkering with new products. He enjoys spending quality time in nature in his free time.

        res = requests.post(api_url + "/privacy/anonymize", json=body)
        session_id = res.json()["session_id"]
        anonymized_messages = res.json()["anonymized_messages"]

      ```json response
      {
        "session_id":"72STNE-ByqSxx28GuNahog",

      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Call LLM Provider">
    Next, use the anonymized prompts from the previous step to call the llm provider. We use openai as an example here.

    ```python call.py
    import openai

    def remove_null_keys(json: dict):
        delete_keys = []
        for k, v in msg.items():
            if v is None:
                delete_keys.append(k)

        for k in delete_keys:
            del msg[k]


    openai.api_key = "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"

    # openai doesn't want null values, so we remove them
    for msg in anonymized_messages:
        remove_null_keys(msg)

    open_ai_msgs = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=anonymized_messages,
    )


    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deanonymize">

  The last step is to deanonymize the messages returned from the LLM provider. This endpoint will return a prompt with deanonymized entities.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```python deanonymize.py

    processed_messages = [choice["message"] for choice in open_ai_msgs["choices"]]
    res = requests.post(api_url + "/privacy/deanonymize", json={"session_id": session_id ,"anonymized_messages": processed_messages})
  ```

  ```json response
{
   "session_id":"go1QTW1-drpEAoO3io999g",
   "messages":[
      {
         "role":"assistant",
         "content":"
          When Rushabh is looking for jobs, there are several factors that hold importance, including compensation, work-life balance, and company mission.\n\n
          
          1. Compensation: Rushabh, despite being early in his career, is willing to forgo a higher salary for the sake of career growth. However, compensation is still an important factor as it determines the financial stability and rewards that come with the job. It includes salary, bonuses, benefits, and other perks. For Rushabh, a decent compensation package that aligns with his financial goals and requirements would be advantageous.\n\n
          
          2. Work-Life Balance: Rushabh values quality time in nature and personal interests. Therefore, work-life balance is important as it determines the equilibrium between work commitments and personal life. Rushabh would prefer a job that allows him to have flexible working hours, time for leisure activities, and the freedom to pursue personal interests outside of work. A company that values work-life balance and provides policies and programs that support it would be appealing to Rushabh.\n\n
          
          3. Company Mission: Rushabh is passionate about technology and loves tinkering with new products. Therefore, the company's mission and values play a crucial role. Rushabh would prefer a company that aligns with his interests and values, especially in the field of technology and innovation. A company with a clear and meaningful mission can provide Rushabh with a sense of purpose and motivation in his work.
          
          \n\nIn summary, when Rushabh is looking for jobs, he considers factors such as compensation, work-life balance, and company mission. While he is willing to prioritize career growth over salary, having a decent compensation package is still important. Additionally, he values work-life balance, allowing him to have time for his personal interests. Lastly, Rushabh looks for a company with a mission and values that align with his passion for technology and innovation.",
