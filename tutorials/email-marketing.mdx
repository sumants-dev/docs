# Personalized Emails for Coffee Shop Grand Opening
## Scenario
Imagine you are managing a coffee shop, and you want to send a personalized email invitation to a customer without revealing their PII (Personally Identifiable Information). In this example, we'll send an email inviting a user to the grand opening of your coffee shop on a specific date. The only specific information we have about the user is their name and location.
## Request to the Privacy Layer
First, we'll make a request to the privacy layer to generate the email content. This request will be based on the user's name and the location of the coffee shop.
