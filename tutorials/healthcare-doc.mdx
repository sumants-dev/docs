# Summarizing Medical Records with PHI

## Scenario
This project aims to summarize medical records while removing protected health information (PHI) from the content. Imagine you are a medical professional tasked with summarizing a medical record. Your goal is to create a concise summary that removes any PHI and makes the medical information easy to understand.

Here's an example of how this process could be implemented in a Python script using an AI model:

## Request to the Privacy Layer
<CodeGroup>
```json health_record.py
import requests

api_url = "http://localhost:8000"

medical_record = """
import requests

# Define the API URL for your chosen model
api_url = "http://localhost:8000"

# Medical record with PHI information
medical_record = """
   Patient Name: Rogers, Pamela
   Date: 6/2/04
   Referral Source: Emergency Department
   Data Source: Patient
   Chief Complaint & ID: Ms. Rogers is 
   a 56 y/o WF Define the reason for the patient’s visit as who has been
   having chest pains for the last week. specifically as possible.

# Send the request to the AI model
