# What is Zero Trust?

Organizations shouldn't need to trust anything inside or outside their boundaries. By using zero-trust software, organizations can be confident that their data will be safeguarded, even in the case of a breach. Reducing the surface area for data breaches will reduce headaches for your tech team and compliance team alike.

Pontus is a zero-trust platform in the following ways

* Pontus anonymizes all data, both at rest and in transit.
* Pontus logs and audits everything that flows through the platform.
