# What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security concept that organization shouldn't need to trust anything inside or outside its boundaries. The concept is "never trust, but always verify". Vendors who don't follow this concept are not Zero Trust, and will require you to trust them with your data. With Pontus, we never know any PII that is being sent through the system. Moreover, we offer on premise hosting that allows you to keep your data within your own network.
