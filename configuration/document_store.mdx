# Specification

The document store defines where documents are kept. We use the documents to create context and sent to LLMs. Our anonymization still applies here at REST and interactions with AI.


## Vector Collection
* `vector_collection` is a document store that is used in retrieval augment generation.
    * `type`- supports `pgvector`
    * `conn_str`- the database connection string
    * `collection_name`- the name of the collection.

## Chunker
* `chunker` take in documents and chunk it in snippets for priming the LLM with context.
    * `type`- supports `simple`, `nltk`, and `spacy`.
    * `chunk_overlap`- the max allowed overlap words between chunks.

## Embedder
* `embedder` generates vector representations for chunks for similarity searching.
    * `type`- supports `sentence_transformer` from hugging face.
    * `model`- supports any sentence transformer model.

## Example
```yaml copy
document_store:
  vector_collection:
    type: pgvector
    conn_str: <put-your-api-key-here>
    collection_name: node
  chunker:
    type: simple
    chunk_overlap: 10
  embedder:
    type: sentence_transformer
    model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```
