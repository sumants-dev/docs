# Specification
## encryption
Pontus encrypts your sensitive data at rest, everywhere, using randomized initial values for every item of data. This ensures that your data is not "pseudonymized", but truly anonymized per GDPR regulation.

* `encryption_method`- Currently supports `AES`.
* `key`- 16, 24, or 32 character base 64 key.

## entity_resolution
Pontus identifies sensitive data together to allow LLMs to learn from context, all without sharing any of the sensitive data with them.

* Current supports `equality` and `containment`.
    * `equality`- treats sensitive data as the same entity only if the data is identical.
    * `containment`- treats sensitive data as the same entity only if one of the data contains the other.

## sensitive_data
Pontus allows you to choose how you define sensitive data.

* `sensitive_data_method`- currently supports `presidio`, Microsoft's NLP PII detector. 
* `threshold`- set the sensitive of sensitive data detection between 0 (most lenient) and 1 (least lenient)
* `sensitive_data_types`- we support the following [`person`, `email_address`, `phone_number`, `person`, `social`, `ip`, `card`, `bank`, `passport`, `ssn`]

# Example
```yaml

  encryption:
    encryption_method: AES
    #Test key, avoid using in production
    key: mcFsaV/gv20q7mUhmI3alg==
  entity_resolution: containment
  sensitive_data:
    sensitive_data_method: presidio
    threshold: .5
    sensitive_data_types:
      - person
      - email_address
```
