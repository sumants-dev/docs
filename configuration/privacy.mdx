# Specification
## encryption

* `encryption_method`- Currently supports presidio from Microsoft. Our anonymizers are non-deterministic to avoid psuedononymization concerns with GDPR compliance.
* `key`- 16, 24, or 32 character base 64 key

## entity_resolution

* Current supports only `equality` or `containment`. Equality would consider Rushabh as a different entity from Rushabh Mehta, while containment would not.

## sensitive_data

* `threshold`- set the sensitivity of anonymizer between 0 (most lenient) and 1 (least lenient)
* `sensitive_data_types`- we support the following [`person`, `email_address`, `phone_number`, `person`, `social`, `ip`, `card`, `bank`, `passport`, `ssn`]
